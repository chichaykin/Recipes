# Recipes

Food application which uses The API is documented here: http://food2fork.com/about/.

It was written mainly in Kotlin and uses Retrofit and RxJava to access web api and Glide to achyncronous image loading, caching and resizing.

In the app I use MVP pattern. See apk ![here](/artifacts/app-debug.apk).
