# Recipes

Android application that uses http://food2fork.com/about/ and allows to search recipes.

It was written mainly in Kotlin and uses Retrofit and RxJava to access web api and Glide to asynchronous image loading, caching and resizing.

There are unit tests of MainPresenter and DetailPresenter.

In the app I use MVP pattern. See apk ![here](/artifacts/app-debug.apk).
